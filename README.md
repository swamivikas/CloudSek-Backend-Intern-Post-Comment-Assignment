# why i choose Django over other 
  Django has built-in features that make it safer to use the user-submitted data on the application
  and django is having inbuilt sqlite database however we cannot use its inbuilt database for large projects 

  and django also provides us these features 
   1. Battries included
   2. flexible and scalable
   4. easy to use
   5. active community (it addapts python community )
